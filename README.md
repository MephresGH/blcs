# Bash Linux Compilation Script

### INTRODUCTION
Bash Linux Compilation Script (BLCS) is a basic script that allows you to compile a regular Linux kernel in a streamlined way.
The purpose of this project is to provide a more basic alternative to linux-tkg, not including any patches or config files.

### DEPENDENCIES
The following tools are required to run BLCS:
- GNU coreutils
- GNU make
- GNU findutils
- git
- cd (shell-dependant; usually standard)
- booster (initramfs generator; optional)

Not having any of those programs will lead to errors. Ensure everything mentioned is installed.
